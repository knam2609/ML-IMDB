The provided dataset is modified "IMDb rating prediction dataset".

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset

It includes a variety of features extracted from movie metadata, including director names, actor names, genres, plot keywords, and more. 

Additionally, this version of the dataset incorporates advanced text processing techniques such as CountVectorizer, Doc2Vec, and FastText to enrich the feature set with textual data from movie titles, genres, and plot keywords.

The dataset is public available for research. Please include detailed relevant citations.

Data Preprocessing

The dataset includes preprocessing and additional features: 

	CountVectorizer: 	Applied to the names of the first, and second listed actors, as well as the director's name, to transform these categorical text data into numerical format based on word counts.
	Doc2Vec: 		Utilized for the genres and plot keywords columns to generate meaningful vector representations of these textual features.
	FastText: 		Employed to create embeddings for the movie titles, capturing the semantic meaning of the titles in a dense vector form.
	Binning IMDb Scores: 	The IMDb scores have been categorized into bins to transform the prediction task into a classification problem.
	Missing Value Handling: Missing values in the dataset have been carefully handled, either by imputation or removal.

The npy files for the extracted features have been provided.
